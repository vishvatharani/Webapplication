Queries:
1) Module : Single module (one PCB - one module)
(modular) 200 UNITS.
End use case is different.

Yulu:
Hardware same, Firmware & Application different.
Assign different message IDs for Module 1 & Module 2.
ADRI:
One Module on Board satisfying all features of Module 1 & Module 2.
(Swappable nature)

200 Modules from ADRI.
Same Hardware + Different FW (100+100)

2) Module will go inside the battery case.

3) Speed Sensor - Is it possible to detect with the help of
Accl - Yulu
External Speed Sensor is required - ADRI.
Drop the Speed Sensor - Yulu.

4) If RPM Can be given by Yulu, ADRI Can be used to calculate the Distance Covered. - Completely Isolate this Module with Existing Yulu Module, Drop the Speed.

5) Goal is Prototyping.

6) Timeline planning - Plan and get back to Yulu.

7) Share the logic, Flow chart share it with Yulu - To confirm the functionality.

8) Yulu will be sharing the pictures of use case scenario.

9) 1.x and 2.x Orientation is changing. (1.x is Horizontal & 2.x is Inclined/Vertical)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vehicle Fall : Parked and fell down, Inclination more than 30 deg.
Accident : Motion - Sudden stop - collision - falling down.
Rash Driving : Bumpy road(Based on Road Condition), Suddenly high speed and low speed.
Vibration Impact on Vehicle : System to understand the Vibration, How much Chasis is subjected to Vibration. (Threshold which should not be detected as Accident, Rash driving).
Vehicle Motion Status : Motion/Rest
Battery Drop Off : Battery falling down. From 3-4 m height. Battery case can withdtand 6-12 drop. How battery would drp generally.
Vibration Impact on Battery : Same as Vibration impact on Vehicle.

Battery Movement & Storage : Similar to Motion/Rest.
Because when battery is removed our module is detached with CAN.
Few Fault flags sent over CAN.
Use EEPROM to store the data and send it may be 3/6 hours once (TBD).

Yulu : IoT will request the module to start broadcasting the data.
If IoT is not asking for data. Do not send it.
Sending frequency - might be decided by IoT, when IoT needs data.

Normal data : Vibration, falls, Accident keep on sending.

Water sensor : Known
Temp & Humidity : What kind of application you are looking for?
Monitoring.. On board sensor.
If the Vehicle is standing in the sun for long time.
Within the module temperature we will be able to give.
If possible integrate Temp & Humidity. Otherwise we will not integrate. (Drop)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Month end launch of New Yulu Vehicle.
Only New versions will be used from now on.
Modules will be put in New Version.
10K Old Modules are available. Since it is swappable battery
it can fit into old vehicles as well.

Yulu is providing IoT to Bajaj.

This HW should be modular. Can be put in any Vehicle.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drop - Speed, Temp & Humidity.
Yulu : Will share the data with ADRI as well.
Unique ID and the data.
CSV Format will be shared by Yulu for our data Analysis.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding Controller :
Choosing Renesas.
Suggest the Hardware design and Mr.Aloka will discuss with their IoT Team.
Cost Factor.
3-Axis Accelerometer.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal doc will be prepared by ADRI and will share it with Yulu. Based on the requirement shared by Mr.Aloka.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding Lock:
Opened Lock & Making the doc on Findings.
How to take it further?
Feasibility of building the lock!!
ADRI : Can you share the Requirement from Yulu to start the Project to make Prototype.
What we need to know in lock, costing, Feasibility of making it in India - then based on that Yulu will come up with the reuirement doc.
